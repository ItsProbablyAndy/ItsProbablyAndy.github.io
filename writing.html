          <h3>Heterotopias - Contributor</h3>
          <p>Contributed a study exploring the impact of technological oppression within the  future-Paris setting highlighting the constant struggle for a historic city to strive for advancement at the cost of building over those unable to afford to maintain the status quo. This work has since been included in the physical edition and has been beautifully framed within the book collection available on the Heterotopias website.</p>

          <h3>Freelance Copywriting - Various</h3>
          <p>Throughout my three years doing freelance work I also picked up the occasional pitch at a variety of publications including several short-form reviews in the print Magazine MYM Mag, as well as a number of digital publications including Rock Paper Shotgun & Glixel (Rolling Stone's now defunct vertical). I was also comissioned to contribute towards Future Publishing's unofficial Fortnite annual. I have also been comissioned to perform several mock reviews for developing projects to help the devs understand how their builds would be received at that stage of the development. </p>
